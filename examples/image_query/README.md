# Image Query Example Requirements

The examples in this directory assume you have the `clipper_admin` pip package installed:

```sh
pip install clipper_admin
```
We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
to install Python packages.

# Running the example query

Run the example: `python example_client.py IMAGE_FILE [...]`. The example will return the size of the image with PIL image library.
