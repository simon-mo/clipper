# Description of CI process

The wonderful AMPlab Jenkins is responsible for running our integration test.
## How does the CI process work (version 2.0)
- We initiate all our tests inside a Docker container

## How does the CI process work (version 1.0)

0. Jenkins pull the PR.
1. Jenkins inject environment variables configured in admin page. Currently, we set the following environment variables 
in Pull Request Builder:
    - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    - CLIPPER_K8S_CERT_AUTH
    - CLIPPER_K8S_CLIENT_CERT
    - CLIPPER_K8S_CLIENT_KEY
    - CLIPPER_K8S_PASSWORD
    - CLIPPER_TESTING_DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD
2. Jenkins will call `run_ci.sh`. It does three things:
    - It calls `build_docker_images.sh` to build all the docker images
    - Then it runs unittests docker container for python2 and python3
    - Each unittest cotnainer will run `ci_checks.sh`
3. `ci_checks.sh` will run two things:
    - (Only in Python2) It runs `check_foramt.sh` to run the linter for C++ and Python
    - It runs `run_unnitests.sh` to run all tests. 
        - (Only in Python3) It will only run the integration test part, which contains all the python tests and R tests
        
## Note on Minikube (WIP)
- We are under the process of moving away from AWS EKS to Minikube in our CI process. Once the PR is in, there will be 
more detail here.
